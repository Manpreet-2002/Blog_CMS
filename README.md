# Blog CMS Hardhat Project

![Blog-CMS](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/79961524/165349615-4bef536f-e45f-46bc-9255-e821cb71b2d5.png)

In this project I learnt how to use Hardhat blockchain development environment as well as ethers.js library to communicate with the deployed instance of the smart contract. I also gained experience of using the Polygon Mumbai testnet and insights to production quality next.js applications.

This project demonstrates a basic Hardhat use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, a sample script that deploys that contract, and an example of a task implementation, which simply lists the available accounts.

Try running some of the following tasks:

```shell
npx hardhat accounts
npx hardhat compile
npx hardhat clean
npx hardhat test
npx hardhat node
node scripts/sample-script.js
npx hardhat help
```
